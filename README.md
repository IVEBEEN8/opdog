## 🎯 Development Purpose And Reason For Topic Selection

Every year, over 100,000 abandoned animals are rescued at conservation centers.
The reality is that no additional efforts are made to promote the adoption of rescue animals at shelter centers other than making an initial announcement.
Therefore, in order to solve this problem, our team create a webpage to encourage adoption of abandoned dogs and continuously promote information about abandoned dogs to have valuable connections between abandoned dogs and adopters, correct misconceptions about abandoned dogs, and promote a responsible pet culture. We hope people change the perspective on abandoned dog and encourage social change.
Our team's ultimate goal is to improve awareness of abandoned dogs and revitalize the pet adoption culture so that more people can join in supporting abandoned dogs and protecting abandoned dogs.

### ❤️‍🔥Impression After The Project

### 🐯 Hyejin Yook
Because the passion of the team members was great, it was a project that I was more ambitious about and wanted to do well as the team leader.
I communicated with individual team member and guided them to do whatever they wanted. As a result, we were able to achieve results that satisfied everyone.
We believe that communication is the key to team projects, so we value transparent and open dialogue in all decisions.
In the process of listening to and respecting the opinions of team members, the atmosphere within the team improved, and when problems arose, they were able to be resolved quickly.
This project was a valuable opportunity to experience the entire process from planning to implementation.
I will remember the days when I happily stayed up all night working on projects, and I will keep in mind the first feeling that I join this team with pleasure.

### 🦊 Heewon Kang
As the first time is always difficult, the first web development was not as easy as imagined.
Not only was it necessary to understand the content learned in class, but it was also necessary to have the ability to interpret codes provided by actual companies or organizations.
Every time I encountered an unknown part during development, my heart pounded like it would explode, however, I realized in the process of developing, it's very important to analyze and interpreate the code.
When my fear of unfamiliar code changed to excitement, I felt how much I had grown through the project.
I am looking forward to the challenges in the future and am extremely grateful for our first web development with the “Open the Dog” team members.

### 🐻 Howon Jeong 
It was my first project. I was very worried about what I could make and what I should do.
In fact, compared to other teams, our team took the longest in the planning part.
However, there were many things I learned after actually going into development, and as a result, I had a disire to learn more about coding and didn't even notice that I stood up all night.
It would be great if it was a perfect plan from the start, but it was a valuable experience that taught me that even if it is not perfect from the beginning, it would be better later, totally depending on how much effort I put into the project.

### 🐹 Kyeole Lee
The project was completed through 4 diffrent persons who have grown up with diffrent environments.
We start from the beginning by sharing the database in the cloud, but the part of entering data into the database is left to Heewon.
Paging processing and log connections are of great help to Howon and overall design processing is of great help to Hyejin.
There is a lot of motivation in the active way one expresses, coordinates, and implements ideas.
In particular, Hyejin helped me a lot as the team leader. I had a wonderful project experience with the amazing team members.
